    -> It will gives listing of all books in json format
    -> you can modify this for searching and filtering functionalities like below:
    -> for search "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/index?search=abc" : It will return all the data which contain abc word in it.
    -> for filter "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/index?author=riya" : It will return all the data which has riya as a author. like this you can apply all the filters through url.
    -> If you want to add both in a single request then: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/index?search=abc&author=riya" : 
    It will give data where author is riya and has abc in its fields.
